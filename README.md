# ecs-clustering
Welcome to my implementation of the Efficient Clustering Scheme for NS-3.

This is an ongoing project as part of the Gillis Lab to complete my MSc Thesis.
The hope is to implement the Efficient Clustering Scheme in order to simulate
Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) in order to better understand how density affects
these networks.
